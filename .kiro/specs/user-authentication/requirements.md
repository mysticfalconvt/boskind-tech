# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Authentication system extends the Ironing Beads Designer to support user accounts, allowing users to save their projects to a PostgreSQL database instead of local storage. The system will use BetterAuth for authentication with username/password login, and include a new account management interface accessible through the header navigation. This enables users to access their projects from any device and provides a foundation for future collaborative features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account with a username and password, so that I can save my bead designs to the cloud and access them from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the account icon in the header THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with "Login" and "Register" options
2. WHEN the user selects "Register" THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with username and password fields
3. WHEN the user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new account and automatically log them in
4. WHEN the user submits invalid registration data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a username is already taken THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to choose a different username

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my username and password, so that I can access my saved bead designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the account icon and selects "Login" THEN the system SHALL display a login form
2. WHEN the user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to their projects
3. WHEN the user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN the user is already logged in THEN the account dropdown SHALL show "Account Settings" and "Logout" options
5. WHEN the user selects "Logout" THEN the system SHALL log them out and redirect to the public view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my bead projects to be saved to my account, so that I can access them from any device and they persist beyond local storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL save it to the PostgreSQL database associated with their account
2. WHEN a logged-in user modifies a project THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes to the database
3. WHEN a logged-in user loads the ironing beads page THEN the system SHALL display their projects from the database
4. WHEN a logged-in user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fall back to local storage with a warning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access account management features, so that I can update my profile and manage my account settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user clicks the account icon THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with account options
2. WHEN the user selects "Account Settings" THEN the system SHALL navigate to an account management page
3. WHEN the user is on the account page THEN the system SHALL display their username and account creation date
4. WHEN the user wants to change their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password change form
5. WHEN the user updates their password THEN the system SHALL require their current password for verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the header navigation to include an account section, so that I can easily access authentication and account features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a person icon in the header between "Personal" and the theme switch
2. WHEN the user is not logged in THEN clicking the account icon SHALL show "Login" and "Register" options
3. WHEN the user is logged in THEN clicking the account icon SHALL show their username, "Account Settings", and "Logout" options
4. WHEN the user hovers over the account icon THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
5. WHEN the user navigates to different pages THEN the account icon SHALL remain consistently positioned in the header

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my projects to be stored securely in the database, so that I can access them from any device and never lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the ironing beads page without being logged in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login
2. WHEN a user creates, edits, or deletes projects THEN the system SHALL perform all operations directly with the database
3. WHEN the user's session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt them to log in again before continuing
4. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL load their projects directly from the database

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL, so that database operations are type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to PostgreSQL using the POSTGRES_URL environment variable
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
3. WHEN the database schema changes THEN the system SHALL support migrations through Drizzle
4. WHEN API routes handle data requests THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle for all database interactions
5. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and return user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share my bead projects publicly, so that other users can discover and be inspired by my designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is editing a project THEN the system SHALL provide an option to mark the project as public or private
2. WHEN a user marks a project as public THEN the system SHALL make it discoverable to other users
3. WHEN a user marks a project as private THEN the system SHALL hide it from public discovery
4. WHEN a user views their project list THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which projects are public vs private
5. WHEN a project is public THEN the system SHALL display the creator's username and creation date

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and search public bead projects created by other users, so that I can find inspiration and discover new design ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the public projects section THEN the system SHALL display a grid of public projects from all users
2. WHEN a user searches for projects THEN the system SHALL filter results by project name and creator username
3. WHEN a user clicks on a public project THEN the system SHALL display it in read-only mode with full design details
4. WHEN viewing a public project THEN the system SHALL show the creator's username, creation date, and project statistics
5. WHEN a user likes a public project THEN the system SHALL provide an option to duplicate it to their own account

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between my personal projects and the public project gallery, so that I can easily switch between creating and discovering content.
